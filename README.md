## What is this?

Metro 13 is a Space Station 13 branch (cloned from [Civilization 13](https://github.com/civ13-SS13/civ13 "Civ13's Github Page")) set in the postapocalyptic hellscape of Metro 2033.

## What state is the project in?

Pre-alpha, the project has mostly assets completed (currently a test map, [many sprites](https://github.com/bennettdrill/metro13/tree/gendev/icons/tempsprites), some sound files, and a fair bit of code). A PvP test of our reworked firearms system is planned for the near future.
